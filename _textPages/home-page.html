<p>Arena is a drafting format where a series of randomized "packs" of four cards are presented to you. Each card you pick is added to your deck. 
    This generator has a certain set of constraints that will lead to a legal deck with a minimum number of essentials.</p>
<p>Start by picking your side. Try to make the best deck you can. And then go over to jinteki.net to find a partner. Enjoy!</p>
